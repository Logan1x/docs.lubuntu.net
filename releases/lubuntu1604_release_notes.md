## System Requirements
Lubuntu is a good operating system for many old computers, but not for all of them. Some computers have too little horsepower or memory. A rule of thumb is that the computer should not be more than 10 years old.

__Memory (RAM)__
<br>
For advanced internet services like Google+, YouTube, Google Drive, and Facebook, your computer needs at least 1 GB of RAM.

For local programs like LibreOffice and simple browsing habits, your computer needs at least 512 MB of RAM.

__Processor (CPU)__
<br>
The minimum specification for CPU is Pentium 4 or Pentium M or AMD K8. Older processors are too slow and the AMD K7 has problems with Flash video.
